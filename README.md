A basic Python wrapper for the [OpenOpus API project](https://openopus.org/) (with which I am unaffiliated). For a detailed description of OpenOpus, definitely check
out their site using the previous link or [their github repo](https://github.com/openopus-org/openopus_api). In short, OpenOpus is an incredibly easy-to-access repository of classical music metadata including:
  * Composers
    - e.g. date of birth/death, name, period, and a handy portrait
  * Works
    - e.g. title, genre
  * Genres
  * Performers (from famous historical performances.recordings)

The main goal of this wrapper is simply to reduce necessary boilerplate code to query and process OpenOpus data in Python applications.
